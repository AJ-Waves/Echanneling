        <p>
            All you have to do is search for the doctor, using the search facility provided on this web site.
            After selecting the required session of the doctor, you have to give details of the patient and
            make the payments to confirm the appointment. You will need a credit card to make the payment;
            any Visa, Master card or American Express credit card is accepted. When you reach the payment page in
            this web site, you should select the relevant Internet Payment Gateway (IPG), either Sampath bank,
            HSBC or Seylan bank for Visa and Master card to process the payment. Thereafter, from this web site, you will be connected
            to the payment gateways of either Sampath bank , HSBC or Seylan bank, or to the payment gateway of American Express
            where you can enter credit card details securely to pay for the appointment. The web site will present you with the receipt
            you should print, to be produced at the hospital.
            If there's no printer available you can just write down the reference number and go to the hospital. You can obtain the channel
            receipt from the channeling counter.

            counter to request the cancellation.
